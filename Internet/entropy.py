"""
Calculate the entropy of network traffic over all ports, by minute.

All files in the 'results' directory named TTT.dports.csv.gz are processed,
where TTT is a time index. These files should have 65536 columns, corresponding
to the possible port numbers.

Each row of an input file is a one-minute time block.

Zeros are dropped prior to computing the entropy.

The output file is always named entropy_minute.csv, and consists of one entropy
value per minute of traffic data.
