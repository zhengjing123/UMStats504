After downloading the zip file, unzip it.  Then recompress with gzip
the file called "Medicare_Provider_Util_Payment_PUF_CY2017.txt".  If
you decide not to gzip it, you will need to modify the code below.

To obtain additional levels of geographic stratification, you will
need to obtain crosswalk files from the links below.

The zip-tract crosswalk is needed to run the script below.
