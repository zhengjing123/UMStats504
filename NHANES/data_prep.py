# This script merges a few NHANES files, so that they can then
# be analyzed, e.g. using regression analysis
#
# First, download some of the NHANES data files.  You can do
# this through the NHANES web site, or on the command line
# using the commands below:
#
# wget https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/DEMO_I.XPT -P data/2015
# wget https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/BPX_I.XPT -P data/2015
# wget https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/BMX_I.XPT -P data/2015

# wget https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/1999-2000/DEMO.XPT -P data/1999

# wget https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/1999-2000/BMX.XPT -P data/1999
